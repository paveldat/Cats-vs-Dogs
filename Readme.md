# Task
Write a neural network that can distinguish between two classes: cats and dogs.
# Files
* Main file to run: dandelions.m
* Images of cats and dogs are located in the "petImagesSelected" folder.
* The images I used for testing are in the "myPictures" folder.
* The report is in the "Report.docx" file
* In order not to train the neural network on a new one, I saved the file "nnetTransfer.mat", just open it and the program will work without training.
